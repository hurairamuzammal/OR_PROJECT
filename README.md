# PP Chemicals - Operations Research Problem Solver

A desktop application for solving Operations Research problems including:

- **Linear Programming** (Simplex Method with Sensitivity Analysis)
- **Assignment Problems** (Hungarian Algorithm)
- **Transportation Problems** (VAM + MODI Method)

## Features

### Linear Programming (Simplex)

- Support for 10+ decision variables and 10+ constraints
- Maximize or minimize objective functions
- Sensitivity analysis with shadow prices and reduced costs
- Allowable ranges for RHS and objective coefficients

### Assignment Problem

- 10x10 or larger cost/efficiency matrices
- Maximize efficiency or minimize cost
- Hungarian Algorithm for optimal assignment
- Visual assignment matrix display

### Transportation Problem

- 10x10 or larger supply-demand matrices
- Three initial solution methods: VAM, Least Cost, NW Corner
- MODI optimization for optimal solution
- Handles balanced and unbalanced problems

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

## Usage

### PP Chemicals Context

This application is designed for PP Chemicals, a chemical manufacturing company for roads and buildings. The three OR problems correspond to:

1. **Linear Programming**: Production optimization - determining optimal production quantities for 10 chemical products (bitumen, plasticizers, coatings, etc.) subject to resource constraints

2. **Assignment Problem**: Worker-task allocation - assigning 10 workers to 10 tasks (mixing, testing, packing, etc.) based on efficiency ratings

3. **Transportation Problem**: Distribution planning - shipping chemicals from 10 plants to 10 construction sites at minimum cost

### Loading Sample Data

Each problem view includes a "Load PP Chemicals Example" button that populates sample data relevant to the chemical industry context.
